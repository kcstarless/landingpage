Landing Page for ODIN HTML/CSS Project

Layout of this webpage is following the guideline from TOP. 

    1. Color theme and fonts was decided first and created colors & fonts HTML page along with CSS.

    2. HTML was written first based on the example layout. Overall layout of website has been made using <div> container.

    3. CSS applied mostly using flex container in order to achieve similar result to the example webpage.

    4. Attempted to make the webpage accessible for mobile devices by using rem instead of pixels as much as possible. More features needs to added as website progresses.

I tried to make this website simple and clean as possible while achieving miminal use of CSS element by reusing CSS elements to minimise duplicates and cluttering of CSS file. 

I plan to add more features especially accessiblility for mobile devices and javascripts.
